# OneTesla SD Interrupter 

re-created OneTesla SD Interrupter PCB based on files from [this page](https://onetesla.com/downloads)   

"original" version is PCB that tries to mimic the OneTesla PCB (with some small improvements), on the other hand "modified" version (for example) doesn't have useless battery holder footprints and has different layout
